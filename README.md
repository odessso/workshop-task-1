## Task Description:

Make a p5.js sketch using 2D primitive shapes, loops, and random numbers. Write own functions and make calls to these functions in your code.

## Notes:

- Focused on code that uses mouse commands e.g. "mouseX" "mouseY"
- experimented with using mouse movement to dictate colour change
- applied new canvas constraints "windowWidth" and "windowHeight"

## Problems Faced:

- Spacing out the houses was difficult
- Code is probably not as concise as it could be - quite convoluted.
